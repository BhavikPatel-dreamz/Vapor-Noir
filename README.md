# Vapor Noir — Premium Vape Storefront

A production-ready **frontend-only** eCommerce storefront built with Next.js 16 (App Router), React 19, TypeScript, Tailwind CSS v4, shadcn-style UI, Framer Motion, Zustand, React Hook Form + Zod, and Swiper.

Designed to be plugged into a **Medusa** backend later without changing the UI layer — all data access goes through `src/lib/api.ts`, which currently returns local dummy data from `src/data/`. Swap those functions for Medusa SDK calls when you're ready.

## Getting started

```bash
npm install
npm run dev
```

Open http://localhost:3000

## Stack

- Next.js 16 · App Router · Server Components by default
- React 19 · TypeScript strict
- Tailwind CSS v4 (CSS-first, `@theme` in `globals.css`)
- Framer Motion, Lucide, Swiper
- Zustand (cart + wishlist, persisted to localStorage)
- React Hook Form + Zod (checkout)
- next/image, next/font (Inter + Playfair Display)

## Connecting to Medusa later

Replace the bodies of `getProducts`, `getProductBySlug`, `getCategories` in `src/lib/api.ts` with Medusa SDK calls. The UI won't change.

**Compliance note:** Vape/e-cig retail requires age verification, tax handling, and region-specific restrictions. Add those in the Medusa layer.
